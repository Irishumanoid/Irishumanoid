# **Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm Iris (humanoid ðŸ‘½)**

## Intro
I mainly make projects relating to control theory and other applied math, robotics, and random backends for websites (usually with Flask). I use Java, Python, JS, MATLAB, LaTeX (it's markdown, but I'll count it) and sometimes, if I'm feeling edgy, Rust. 

## Relevant experience
